# Analog automation
To develop an automated system that analyzes an analog circuit netlist and infers its functionality, eliminating the need for manual interpretation and simulation.

## List of files
Probability_model = splitting of keywords mechanism
BISTM_model = RNN + BISTM model
graph_circuit_lumping = lumping of components in parallel and series (R and C)

## How to run
you can run each file by running the code attached in google collab (you have an option on top called "open in collab")
