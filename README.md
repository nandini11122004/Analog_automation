# Analog Automation

To develop an automated system that analyzes an analog circuit netlist and infers its functionality, eliminating the need for manual interpretation and simulation.

## List of Files

- **Probability_model**: Splitting of keywords mechanism.
- **BISTM_model**: RNN + BISTM model.
- **graph_circuit_lumping**: Creating a graph structure using the components and connctions from the netlist and lumping components in parallel and series(R and C).

## How to Run

You can run each file by executing the code attached in Google Colab. There is an option at the top called "Open in Colab" to access it.
